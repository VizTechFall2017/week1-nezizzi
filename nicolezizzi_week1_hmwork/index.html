    <p> I am a three year M.Arch student and this is my first semester.  I graudated from the University of Rochester in 2014 with a B.S. in Physics and a minor in Dance.  The University of Rochester offers a unique program called Take 5 in which students submit a proposal for a interdisciplinary program of study outside of his or her major or minor.  I was a Take 5 Scholar for the academic year of 2014/2015 and my self-made program was called &quot;Architecture: Building the Bridge between Creativity and Logic&quot;. I moved to Boston upon completing my Take 5 year in the summer of 2015. I then started my own Boston based dance company, Evolve Dynamicz.  We started out as just two dancers, me and my dance partner Lisa and we have since grown into a company of 9! We have performed around the Boston aread as well as in New York and Southern Vermont.  At the end of August, we put on our first ever full length production called &quot;SPACES&quot;, for which I designed a set of architectural objects to perform with.  (See picture!) I am so excited to be here at Northeastern and to see where my studies in Architecture and Design take me!  </p>
